  - Array parameter handling
  - Unicode API

Here is the list of changes in the 3.51.06:

-- Fix for the ADO when handling long text field with 0 
   length data.

-- Fixed a ADO/Visual Basic when using with MySQL server 
   >= 4.0.8 when there is a syntax error due to the 
   error message buffer over flow.

   based updates/deletes and when 
    - there are no key fields present in the table & 
    - the schema of the table is changed.

-- Fixed to refresh the initialized SQLSTATEs in the 
   driver when the ODBC version is changed and when the 
   multiple instances of driver is loaded into to the 
   memory.

-- Fixed a minor bug when the bulk inserts are performed 
   from SQLBulkOperations or SQLSetPos with SQL_ADD and 
   when the wrong pcbValue is passed.

Recommended upgrade to all earlier versions of MyODBC 
on all platforms.
 
---------------------------------------------		
19-Dec-2002 : monty@mysql.com, venu@mysql.com
---------------------------------------------
This is the gamma release of MyODBC 3.51.05. This 
should be the final release in the development series 
before making the stable announcement unless if 
there is any criticil bugs from this version. 

So, please test this, and let us know the status back 
to proceed onto stable release.

Here is the list of changes:

-- Fix for the thread-safe library core dumps when the 
   driver is built with the debug options. 

-- Fix for OpenOffice to return valid list of catalog 
   names SQLTables along with a valid catalog name.

-- Fixed SQLTablePrivileges and SQLColumnPrivileges to 
   return each privilege type in a individual rows.

-- Fixed the time connersion format error from SQL_TIME_STRUCT

   (Thanks to Ocke Janssen<ocke.janssen@sun.com> for the 
    above 3 bugs from OpenOffice team).

-- Fixed SQLSpecialColumns coredump on HP-UX (threaded 
   library)

-- Fixed SQLGetTypeInfo to return individual rows for 
   auto_increment status for all numeric types.
   (Request from Gerry Sweeney <gerry@support-works.com>)

-- Fixed to return an error when the conversion is from 
   SQL_C_NUMERIC as the driver is not cabale to handle 
   SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT conversion due to lack of descriptors 
   support.
   (Request from Michael Thomas <mithomas@microsoft.com>
    from Microsoft ODBC team)

-- Added missed ROWS_FETCH_PTR status to SQLFetch and 
   SQLExtendedFetch as that of SQLFetchScroll along 
   with PARAMA_PROCESSED_PTR.

-- Fixed to not to set the default attributes for the 
   new DSN when the attributes are set through the config 
   APIs (Windows specific).

-- Added to return the DRIVER name when there is no DSN 
   is specified (Linux only).

-- Support for the new autoconf tools along with few 
   new configurations options.

-- Lot of cleanups to configure script to work on all 
   unix platforms along with gcc 3.x compatibility.

-- Added distribution uitlity scripts under scripts 
   sub-directory.

    * Binary distribution support for all platforms
    * Snapshot source distribution

-- Minor fix-ups to work with native compilers.

-- Lot of code cleanup.

Recommended upgrade to earlier versions on all 
platforms.

---------------------------------------------		
30-Sep-2002 : monty@mysql.com, venu@mysql.com
---------------------------------------------
Release of 3.51.04 with the following bug fixes or 
improvements:

-- Support for handling large tables without 
   caching the entire result set. Now one can force 
   the driver to use non-cache result sets (mysql_use_
   result instead of mysql_store_result). Note that 
   this can be used only with forward-only cursors.
   
-- Added --enable-thread-safe and --disable-thread-safe
   options to configure, so that driver links directly 
   with thread-safe or non thread-safe client libraries 
   instead of using the explicit symbolic links.
   
-- Fixed SQLTables to not to return any data related 
   to SYSTEM TABLES due to the conflict of database 
   names. This should allow 'WinSQL' to show the 
   correct user tables without any duplicates.
   
-- Fixed few core dumps from HP-UX and AIX 

-- Cleanups to thread-safe code (debug calls)

-- Added the driver to check for pre-connection 
   attributes (AUTOCOMMIT, TXN_ISOLATION) values after 
   the connection instead of returning error when they
   are set before the connection.

-- Poratbility changes for MySQL 4.0.3 and 4.1.
  
-- Fix to SQLForeignKeys when the CREATE TABLE had a 
   COMMENT syntax.
   
-- Two new options 'Force use of forward-only cursors' 
   and 'Don't cache results' to help large scale 
   customers.
   
-- Fix to rs.update when server side cursor is used. 

-- Changes for error handling w.r.t. MySQL 4.3.

-- Multi-step generated error fixups.

-- Lot of code cleanup
   
-- Improvements to driver logging calls (myodbc.log 
   and myodbc.sql)

-- Few misc portability changes to build the driver 
   on various UNIX platforms, and

-- Lot of code cleanup to have better performance:   

Recommended upgrade to earlier versions on all 
platforms.

---------------------------------------------		
29-May-2002 : monty@mysql.com, venu@mysql.com
---------------------------------------------
Release of 3.51.03 with the following bug fixes or 
improvements:

   digits (Bug from Michael Thomas [mithomas@microsoft.com])

-- Fix for ADO/DAO empty string issue (Bug from Tom 
   DeGerlia [tom@denverdata.com])
   
-- Fix for BLOB data reading from ADO/DAO (Bug from   
   Justin Goodwin [justin.andre.goodwin@ntlworld.com])
  
-- Support of new Query Log option, which allows the 
   driver to log all SQL queries that it is processing 
   to c:/myodbc.sql file (or /tmp/myodbc.sql)
  
-- Added code to have one time initialization when the 
   ODBC version specified is SQL_OV_ODBC2, so that the 
   subsequent driver calls will not perform any checks 
   on ODBC version.
   
-- Fix to return an error when the float fields are used 
   in positioned options( Info from Jim Dickenson 
   [dickenson@cfmc.com])

-- Fix for errors generated during the export of tables with
   VARCHAR/TEXT from Access/MS DTS to MySQL using MyODBC. Now
   driver should be capable of handling all types of 
   conversions.

-- Fix to handle SQL_C_BINARY properly (Info from 
   Spilka [spilka@adash.cz])

-- Added MY_SQL_PRIMARY_KEY(1212) option to SQLColAttribute 
   to make rs.resync to work from ADO (Info from 
   Dan Perik [dan_perik-work@ntm.org.pg])

-- Updated SQLSTATE to return correct truncated data during 
   the warning cases (Info from akbar ali [akbar_ali@lycos.com])

-- Fixed type casting issues in SQLGetInfo to make Open Office 
   to work-Memory overwrite (Bug from Ocke Janssen 
   [Ocke.Janssen@sun.com])
   
-- Fix to SQLFetch when it is called after SQLFetchScroll 
   with SQL_FETCH_FIRST (Bug from Simone Tregnago 
   [simone@arco3.it]).
   
-- Minor fix in mapping SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT option to 
   mysql_options with MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT.

---------------------------------------------
Release of 3.51.02 with the following bug fixes or 
improvements:

-- Fix to SQLDriverConnect to return  correct output 
   string. This is the main fix for 'Reserved error 
   (-7778)' from all Windows ODBC applications. 
   
-- Fix to hang from unixODBC when there is a exception. 
   Modified SQLError to clear the error buffers on the 
   first call when the ODBC version is SQL_OV_ODBC3, so 
   that the subsequent calls will return SQL_NO_DATA.
   
-- Fix to SQL_UPDATE and SQL_ADD from SQLSetPos. Also 
   changed to have different way of using the NULL 
   values from WHERE clause.
   
-- Fix to SQLSetPos and SQLBulkOperations, when the 
   application passes SQL_NTS as pcbValue.
   
-- Fix to SQLColumns to return the correct Nullability.
   
-- Added the support of SQLTablePrivileges and 
   SQLColumnPrivileges.   
   
-- Fix to SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_DEAD. This should fix the 
   issues from SQLExpress for XBase++ and .NET connection 
   closed issues.
   
-- Fix to SQLGetTypeInfo to return correct values for 
   SQL_DATE/SQL_TYPE_DATE, SQL_TIME/SQL_TYPE_TIME and 
   SQL_TIMESTAMP/SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP.
   
-- Fix to tab ordering ordering from DSN configuration 
   dialog.
   
-- Added default values for the new DSN creation.

-- Fix to export of tables from ACCESS 97 or MS DTS(
   Data Transformation Services) when one of the field 
   types are TEXT or VARCHAR.
   
-- Added few more questions to MyODBC FAQ and also added 
   simple ODBC.NET samples.
   
If anybody is using the older versions of MyODBC 3.51, 
then recommended to upgrade to this version for all 
platforms.
