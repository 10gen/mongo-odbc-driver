INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source or binary distribution of ODBC for 
MySQL. This software is distributed with restrictions - please
see the license file for details.

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a widely accepted standard
for reading/writing data. ODBC is designed in a similar manner
to the MS Windows printing system in that it has a Driver Manager
and Drivers. Connector/ODBC is a driver for the ODBC system which
allows applications to communicate with the MySQL Server using
the ODBC standard. ODBC implementations exist on all popular
platforms and MySQL Connector/ODBC is also available on those 
platforms. 

MySQL, the most popular Open Source SQL database, is 
provided by the MySQL engineering team at Sun Microsystems, Inc. 

MySQL provides the support for ODBC by means of Connector/ODBC 
driver and programs. Connector/ODBC is the ODBC driver 
for MySQL which is ODBC 3.5x compliant and MyODBC is
2.5x compliant.

To get all functionality from the ODBC 3.51 or 5.1 driver (like
transaction support) you should use it against MySQL 4.1 or above.

BUILDING SOURCE
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the BUILD file for details on building the source
code. This is included with the source distribution.

INSTALLING
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for details on installing.

BINARY FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following, key, files are provided by Connector/ODBC (the MS 
Windows names are included for reference but the file names for 
other platforms would be similar).

Driver (myodbc3.dll or myodbc5.dll)

        The most important part of Connector/ODBC is the driver.
        Application developers can link directly to the driver but 
        more often use the driver indirectly, via a Driver Manager
        such as the one provided by Microsoft or unixODBC.

        Many options can be provided to the driver to adjust its
        behaviour.

        Note that in MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51 on Unix and Linux,
        there are two different library packages, one compiled for non
        threaded usage "libmyodbc3" and one compiled for threaded
        usage "libmyodbc3_r". In 5.1 there is only one library,
        "libmyodbc5", compiled for threaded usage.

Setup Library (myodbc3S.dll)

        The setup library provides a graphical user interface needed
        during certian activities provided by the driver. For example;
        it provides the GUI when you use the ODBC Administrator to
        create/edit a Data Source Name (DSN).

Installer (myodbc3i.exe or myodbc-installer.exe)

        This command-line utility program can be used to manage ODBC
        system information. For example it can be used to register
        or deregister a driver. It can also manage data source names.
        This was created to test the ODBC system information
        abstraction and portability layer within Connector/ODBC but 
        is also useful for installing and uninstalling Conector/ODBC.

        Invoke the 3.51 "myodbc3i" or the 5.1 "myodbc-installer", in
        a command shell and without options, to get help on its use.

Library Loading Tester (dltest.exe)

        This command-line utility is not included in the binary
        packages, but will be built if you build from source. It is
        useful fo debugging problems related to loading a library
        and resolving symbols in it.
